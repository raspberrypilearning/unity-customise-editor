You can customise the Unity Editor to have the layout that is easiest for you to navigate. 

Unity has a number of predefined layouts that you can chose from by clicking on the **Layout** drop-down box and selecting your preferred view.

You can customise these layouts by clicking on the tab at the top of any of the Scene or Game views, or Hierachy, Project, and Inspector windows and dragging them to a new position.

After customising a layout, you can save it to use again later by clicking on the **Layout** drop-down box and selecting **Save Layout...**.
